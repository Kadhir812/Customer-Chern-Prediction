# Customer Churn Prediction with Random Forest

This project aims to predict customer churn using a Random Forest Classifier. The dataset is preprocessed, and various steps, including feature scaling, label encoding, and hyperparameter tuning, are performed to build a robust machine learning model. The project also includes visualizations like the ROC curve for evaluating model performance.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to identify patterns in customer data to predict whether a customer is likely to churn. This prediction can help businesses take proactive steps to retain valuable customers.

## Dataset

The project uses two datasets:
- `customer_churn_dataset-training-master.csv` (Training data)
- `customer_churn_dataset-testing-master.csv` (Testing data)

These datasets contain customer information, including demographic, account, and usage details. The target variable is `Churn`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repo-name>
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the training and testing datasets in the specified file paths.
2. Run the Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance:
   ```bash
   python cuschern.py
   ```

## Model Training and Evaluation

- The training dataset is preprocessed by filling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the processed data.
- The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like the classification report, AUC-ROC score, and ROC curve.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

GridSearchCV is used for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the Random Forest model. The following parameters are tuned:
- `n_estimators`
- `max_depth`
- `min_samples_split`
- `min_samples_leaf`

The best parameters and their corresponding AUC-ROC score are displayed in the output.

## Results

- **Initial Model AUC-ROC**: Displayed after training the initial Random Forest model.
- **Optimized Model AUC-ROC**: Displayed after hyperparameter tuning.
- **ROC Curve**: A graphical representation of the model's performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization

## Future Enhancements

- Experiment with other machine learning algorithms such as Gradient Boosting or XGBoost.
- Perform feature selection to improve model performance.
- Integrate the model into a web application for real-time predictions.
